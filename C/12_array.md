# Array

Arrays can be any data type, including self-defined structs

    int numbers[] = { 100, 200. 55. 91 };

Has storage amount equal to the amount of elements/values.

    int numbers[3];

Has a storage amount of 3 elements.

    numbers[0]

Gets the first element stored in the array. As arrays start at 0, so the 2nd element will be `numbers[1]`
